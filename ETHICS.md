- Extracting data from systems you don't own

### When You CAN Use This Tool

✅ **Authorized Scenarios:**
1. Scanning your own code/applications
2. Security audits with **written authorization** from the system owner
3. Bug bounty programs with explicit scope definitions
4. Educational purposes on isolated test environments
5. Open-source projects (respecting their security policies)

### When You CANNOT Use This Tool

❌ **Prohibited Scenarios:**
1. Scanning production systems without authorization
2. Testing third-party websites/APIs without permission
3. Competitive intelligence gathering
4. Any form of unauthorized penetration testing
5. Scanning employer code after termination

## Required Documentation

Before scanning any system you don't personally own:

1. **Written Authorization Letter** containing:
   - Explicit permission to conduct security testing
   - Defined scope (which systems/code)
   - Testing timeframe
   - Authorized testing methods
   - Emergency contact information

2. **Scope Agreement** defining:
   - IP ranges/domains/repositories
   - Out-of-scope systems
   - Acceptable risk levels
   - Data handling procedures

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities:

1. **DO NOT** exploit or exfiltrate data
2. Document findings with evidence
3. Report privately to the vendor/owner
4. Allow 90 days for patching before public disclosure
5. Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) practices

## Bug Bounty Programs

When participating in bug bounties:
- Read and follow program rules exactly
- Stay within defined scope
- Use authorized testing accounts
- Report findings through official channels
- Never demand payment or threaten disclosure

## Academic/Research Use

Educational use is permitted if:
- Testing occurs on isolated lab environments
- No real user data is accessed
- Research institution has approved the project
- Findings are shared responsibly

## Consequences of Misuse

**Criminal Penalties (India):**
- Section 43: Compensation up to ₹1 crore
- Section 66: Imprisonment up to 3 years + fines
- Section 66C (Identity theft): Up to 3 years imprisonment
